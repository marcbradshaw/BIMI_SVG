1.  Introduction

   The Brand Indicators for Message Identification (BIMI) specification
   has a requirement that associated image files must be SVG documents.
   These documents are meant to be self-contained and scalable.  SVG
   does allow for elements that can create challenges.  By limiting
   BIMI-related SVG documents to a subset of the overall SVG
   specification, this should make the above goal more feasible.

   Currently, the SVG standard is at version 1.1 [W3C.REC-
   SVG11-20110816], while SVG Tiny is at 1.2 [W3C.REC-
   SVGTiny12-20081222], and these are both W3C standards.  The
   definition below will outline SVG 1.2 BIMI, an SVG profile that is
   suitable for use with BIMI.  This new profile will use SVG Tiny as a
   base.

2.2.  Disallowed sections

   THe attributes described in the sections below are expressly
   forbidden from use in SVG 1.2 BIMI:

   o  12 Multimedia

   o  13 Interactivity

   o  14 Linking

   o  15 Scripting

   o  16 Animation

   o  18 Metadata

2.3.  Unadvised Sections

   The sections below are of questionable value to the documents, but
   are not expressly forbidden.

   o  17 Fonts

2.4.  Required Attributes

   The attribites below are required for SVG 1.2 BIMI.  These should be
   declared in the base "<svg>" tag.

   o  title: This is a space where the title of the entity MUST be
      published.  This may allow for individuals with disabilities to
      have some knowledge about the image.  For brevity, this SHOULD be
      no more 64 characters.

   o  desc: A longer description would be permitted here, if necessary.

   o  version: This attribute MUST be set to "1.2".

   o  baseProfile: This attribute MUST be set to "tiny".

   o  zoomAndPan: This attribute MUST be set to disable, as it may cause
      issues in a user interface.

   o  externalResourcesRequired: This attribute MUST be set to "false"
      so that external resources are not required for rendering.

   o  preserveAspectRatio: This should be set to xMidYMid, and should
      center the image in the viewbox when the size is changed.
