.# Abstract

This document specifies SVG 1.2 BIMI -- An SVG profile to be used for
images that are meant to be displayed in conjunction with BIMI.

{mainmatter}

# Introduction

The Brand Indicators for Message Identification (BIMI) specification has 
a requirement that associated image files must be SVG documents. These
documents are meant to be self-contained and scalable.  SVG does allow
for elements that can create challenges.  By limiting BIMI-related SVG
documents to a subset of the overall SVG specification, this should make
the above goal more feasible.

Currently, the SVG standard is at version 1.1 [W3C.REC-SVG11-20110816], 
while SVG Tiny is at 1.2  [W3C.REC-SVGTiny12-20081222], 
and these are both W3C standards.  The definition below will outline 
SVG 1.2 BIMI, an SVG profile that is suitable for use with BIMI.  This new
profile will use SVG Tiny as a base.
