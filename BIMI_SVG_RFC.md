.# Abstract

This document specifies SVG 1.2 BIMI -- An SVG profile to be used for
images that are meant to be displayed in conjunction with BIMI.

{mainmatter}

# Introduction

The Brand Indicators for Message Identification (BIMI) specification has 
a requirement that associated image files must be SVG documents. These
documents are meant to be self-contained and scalable.  SVG does allow
for elements that can create challenges.  By limiting BIMI-related SVG
documents to a subset of the overall SVG specification, this should make
the above goal more feasible.

SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) has been developed by W3C, the World
Wide Web Consortium; its current standard is SVG 1.1 Full
[@W3C.REC-SVG11-20110816].  This document defines SVG 1.2 RFC, an SVG
profile (i.e., a subset of SVG) that is suitable for RFC line
drawings.
